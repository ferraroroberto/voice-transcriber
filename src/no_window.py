"""One definition of the Windows ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` subprocess flag.

Every ``subprocess`` spawn that launches an external console executable
(``git``, ``netstat``, ``taskkill``, ``powershell.exe``, ``tailscale``, a
helper script, ...) must pass ``creationflags=NO_WINDOW`` on Windows. A parent
with no console of its own -- a ``pythonw`` tray, a scheduled task, a daemon,
an agent's captured shell -- otherwise makes Windows allocate a fresh console
per child, flashing a window on screen; on a poll loop that reads as malware
or a stuck app. See ``CLAUDE.md`` -> "Windows console-subprocess suppression
(``CREATE_NO_WINDOW``)" (project-scaffolding#13, fleet-config#399).

Import the flag from here instead of re-deriving the
``sys.platform == "win32"`` ternary at each call site::

    from src.no_window import NO_WINDOW

    subprocess.run([...], creationflags=NO_WINDOW)

**Vendor-verbatim modules are the one exception and keep a local definition.**
A file copied byte-identical into adopter repos cannot import a module of this
repo's -- the copy would not resolve, and the hash-verified bytes must stay
self-contained. A handful of such files therefore derive the flag themselves
on purpose, and that is not drift: every ``src`` catalogued in
``.fleet.toml``'s ``[components]`` table (read via
``scripts/vendored_catalog.py``) is a vendor-verbatim publication, and
``tests/test_no_window_convention.py`` derives its allow-list from that same
catalog.

Stdlib-only and side-effect-free, so a standalone script launched outside the
project venv can import it after putting the repo root on ``sys.path``.
