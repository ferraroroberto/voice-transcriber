# Run the Playwright smoke suite against a live tray on https://127.0.0.1:8443.
# Tray must be started separately (tray.bat); this script does not boot it.
#
# Usage:
#   .\scripts\run-e2e.ps1            # run the smoke suite
#   .\scripts\run-e2e.ps1 --headed   # forward any extra args to pytest
#
# If the tray isn't up, conftest.py skips the suite with a clear message.
